# UI Guidelines

* whenever a button is pressed, it should be visible and the text should change. Text should start by "..." or ">"
* Limit actions and information to what is visible and needed. e.g if we have no urgent tasks do not display "urgent(0)". Same thing applies to actions. If we are reordering and the user is not supposed to be editing or tagging, hide the components

-------------------------
#Homepage:
## colors
I want darkish colors. Nothing that blinds you. Minimal amount of white. Although I love how clean the white looks. I want to explore a darker theme

## elements
* top bar should be simple. Logo, Product Name on the left, and login button/link on the right.
I will limit the support to google for now and keep the direct login. No signup bullshit or forms

* The hero unit should emphasize three things:
	* the product name
	* a very short description. A one-liner that doesn't sound like business bullshit or marketing buzzwords. Just a mantra or a principle we stand for and that defines the whole philosophy/vision behind the product
	* a demo link with _maybe_ a screenshot of the actual app or a video. The problem with videos is making a new one every time we add a new feature. So, video needs to be around problem->solution, or concepts (GTD, prioritizing, time management, workflow etc.)
	* maybe consider a "Screenshots" link to explore the software. The Demo I have in mind is too interactive and could take longer to build

* Marketing table
	* Should cover one or two common features and emphasize what's different about the product
		* Tagging + Projects
		* Calendar (ical, GCal) syncing
		* Offline access
		* Cloud storage
		* Mobile + Tablet support (touch)
		* Chrome + Firefox extensions
		* Keyboard shortcuts
		* App feel (no page reloads)
		* Open-Source
		* Import/Export
		* API

	* Do the research once and add a link at the bottom. "Is the data incorrect? Let us know" Link should redirect to support page with a specific template

* Footer
	* Footer should be similar
		* Report a problem -- redirects to support page (consider specific templates + make it easy to report feedback and most importantly do followups + try to make it public)
		* FAQ (a guess on most common questions based on support)
		* Blog (blog strictly related to this product)
		* About us (should mostly emphasize other products)

Quick Notes:
* consider TodoApp, or TaskTree (check with Jason), or TMS (TaskManagementSoftware). Definitely liking TaskTree. It sounds less techy and less common
* Take the time to research the competion for the marketing table

# main page

* top bar 
	* overview
	* capture
	* process
	* organize
	* review 
	* do
	* sync icon (green line or thunder line)
	* network icon (green or red if offline)

* second bar
	* display current tag filters at the top and allow user to toggle them -- __maybe__
	
	* on the far left
	* Select
		Multiple select.
		Allows a user to select multiple tasks. 
		Looks like a button
		When pressed, it should clear all items on the second bar and button becomes. "Clear Selection"
		It should also display a count of selected items e.g Selected(2)
		Selected items should have a specific background or border and all actions on those items should be limited to avoid conflicts or confusion
		After selecting items, you can apply multiple tags to them
		Applying Tags:
			select items
			check the tags
			Hit "Apply"
			Action is completed and a notice appears with an "Undo" action and a 30 secs timeout
			If "Undo" is pressed, it will cancel the previous action

		
	* Reorder
		Allows a user to order multiple tasks
		Same thing as select. Hide/disable everything and only keep what is necessary
		The whole task item becomes a drag-and-drop handle and you can reorder them (sort) or move them _into_ a parent
		When pressed, button should transform to "...Done Reordering"

* side component: should follow the scroll like the top bar but on the left side
	* search
	* tags
		* current/selected tags (acting as filters)
			If any filters are available
			Consider putting them at the top(second bar) to keep the sidebar light. 
			Maybe use a smaller font and keep them strictly informational -- no checkboxes to toggle
		* current tags associated to selected item
			This should be a fixed block and clearly separated from the rest of the tags.
			It should be dynamic and change whenever a new task item is selected
			If I hit escape (i.e no item is selected), it should be empty.
			It shouldn't be moving around and become distracting
			Ideally, the space should be custom. i.e on average, how many tags are associated to an item. Than, we reserve that space. This way the component looks fixed.

		* list of all tags
			* have a quick search box to look for tags for quick filtering
			* have a little option for sorting
				* alphabetical
				* priority
			* a tag should have a checkbox and a disabled text input you can double click on
			* same concept applies in term of navigation (up/down, enter for edit)
