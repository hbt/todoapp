Homepage:
## colors
I want darkish colors. Nothing that blinds you. Minimal amount of white. Although I love how clean the white looks. I want to explore a darker theme

## elements
* top bar should be simple. Logo, Product Name on the left, and login button/link on the right.
I will limit the support to google for now and keep the direct login. No signup bullshit or forms

* The hero unit should emphasize three things:
	* the product name
	* a very short description. A one-liner that doesn't sound like business bullshit or marketing buzzwords. Just a mantra or a principle we stand for and that defines the whole philosophy/vision behind the product
	* a demo link with _maybe_ a screenshot of the actual app or a video. The problem with videos is making a new one every time we add a new feature. So, video needs to be around problem->solution, or concepts (GTD, prioritizing, time management, workflow etc.)
	* maybe consider a "Screenshots" link to explore the software. The Demo I have in mind is too interactive and could take longer to build

* Marketing table
	* Should cover one or two common features and emphasize what's different about the product
		* Tagging + Projects
		* Calendar (ical, GCal) syncing
		* Offline access
		* Cloud storage
		* Mobile + Tablet support (touch)
		* Chrome + Firefox extensions
		* Keyboard shortcuts
		* App feel (no page reloads)
		* Open-Source
		* Import/Export
		* API

	* Do the research once and add a link at the bottom. "Is the data incorrect? Let us know" Link should redirect to support page with a specific template

* Footer
	* Footer should be similar
		* Report a problem -- redirects to support page (consider specific templates + make it easy to report feedback and most importantly do followups + try to make it public)
		* FAQ (a guess on most common questions based on support)
		* Blog (blog strictly related to this product)
		* About us (should mostly emphasize other products)

Quick Notes:
* consider TodoApp, or TaskTree (check with Jason), or TMS (TaskManagementSoftware). Definitely liking TaskTree. It sounds less techy and less common
* Take the time to research the competion for the marketing table
